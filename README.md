# Vert.x smtp client

A very preliminary version of a smtp client for vert.x.

Currently this is working with Vert.x 2.1.*, its missing a few bits to be
really useful most importantly it has no real vert.x api yet. The main
verticle shows how this could be used, the whole client is async and
supports SSL, STARTTLS, SASL).

For now the source is available at https://github.com/alexlehm/vertxmail

For feedback please send a mail at alexlehm@gmail.com

(Please note that this was done as an effort entirely on my own time. If
you are working for the same company as I am, please do not send me
feedback via my work email address)
